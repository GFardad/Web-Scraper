2. **price** (float): Current price as a numerical value
3. **currency** (string): Currency code (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
4. **original_price** (float|null): Original price before discount, or null if not discounted
5. **availability** (string): One of: "in_stock", "out_of_stock", "preorder", "unknown"
6. **product_id** (string|null): Product ID, SKU, or unique identifier

9. **images** (array): List of image URLs (up to 5 main images)
